                    <p> An effective website should be able to fulfill its intended function. There are many factors towards
                        this idea such as consistency, simplicity, and functionality. It's important that the website has a clear
                        purpose towards it. Meeting the user needs will help users interact with what is displayed on the website. (Marianne, 2018)
                        Ideally, simplicity is a key factor towards good web design. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's once said "Less is More" 
                        (- = +). <br> <br>
                        This is interesting because from an article by Joe Fassler, he stated that a friend went through
                        each sentence suggesting that he cuts his word count by a significant amount because there's 
                        so "much flab there in most writing" (Fassler, 2013). This is interesting because we can also use this 
                        concept for web design to make our websites look aesthetically pleasing while fulfilling the users
                        goals on a webpage. This allows web designers to have less on the page, which is better than a large amount
                        of elements which do not harmonize well with each other. <br> <br>

                        Good web design includes efficient code. Using while and for loops ensures that code is not 
                        repeated x amount of times when it only needs to be printed out once inside a loop. It's important 
                        that coders use the right loops in the right situation. Ideally we use while loops when asking for the 
                        users input. This is used in-conjunction with the prompt keyword as we can also use an if else 
                        statement to check whether or not the input is correct. For loops are useful when programmers 
                        understand how many times a loop for execute (n times). If I want my program to loop 10 times, I can 
                        set up a for loop that repeats 10 times inside of using a while loop.
