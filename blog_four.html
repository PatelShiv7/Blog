                    <p> Many users are still confronted with barriers hindering them from participating online. This is because
                        the numerious positive advantages of the digital world do not extend to all members of society. 

                        The Digital Divide is the inequality which exists in society in relation to accessing the internet and other
                        means of technology. <br> <br>
                        What does it mean to be digitally included? - An individuals ability to afford, access and have the digital
                        capabilities required to connect to and operate online technologies successfully.

                        Who are mainly affeced by this? - People aged 65+, low-income households, users with disabilities, people with
                        mobile-only internet access. <br> <br>

                        This idea is interesting because us as young adults don't think about this as most of us have never experienced
                        these problems. <br> <br>

                        There are many barriers that affected older people when it came to using technology, This included: 
                        Fear - Some users feared they'd do something wrong or that they were worried about privacy issues on a 
                        website (Wilson, 2021). <br>
                        Physical functioning - Text size and buttons were too small (Wilson, 2021). <br>
                        Self-confidence - Participants experience low confidence and not having a "technology mind". Some also
                        lacked patience with technology (Wilson, 2021).
