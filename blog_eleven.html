                                                    <p> Like most other groups, we had some problems with making our website fully responsive. We took the wrong approach
                                                     and didn't use VW as much as wanted to. This meant that our website wasn't compatible with tablets & different
                                                     screen sizes. <br> <br>
                                                     Our grid section was also different as we weren't too sure on how to approach it in terms of code. <br> <br>
                                                     If we had more time, we would fix up the grids and vw so that they were both responsive to all devices and 
                                                     screen sizes. <br> <br>
                                                     Our filter content was also a challenge when we needed to implement it with our grids. Our resolution was to
                                                     create a seperate page once you clicked on a fitler. </p> </div>
