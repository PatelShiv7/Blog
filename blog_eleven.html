                    <p> Our group presentation went well. Our group potentially could have talked more towards the rationale side, however, we looked at the brief and it said that we didn’t need to cover that + we wanted to make our presentation as interesting as possible. The assignment showed me how important it is to organise time as a group. If this were an individual assignment, I would have ensured that I finished everything 3 days before the hand in. When working in this group, it was more focused towards getting it done the night before the hand-in date which is not what I’m used to.<br> <br>
                        It was really cool to see the other groups present their website. Especially watching Jamie’s group as it showed me how much JavaScript can be used to add interactivity. Because of their presentation, it made me want to research more JavaScript concepts that can be used on websites. <br> <br>
                        This course has shown me how to apply both design and programming thinking towards my work. I really enjoyed learning about ageism as this is an idea that designers / programmers don’t often think about. The pre-recorded lectures have been very useful to watch (will definitely be re-watching them over the break).  <br> <br>
                        Thank you Eujeen for being such a supportive lecturer. Most of us had low expectations for this course as IXXN221 set the bar quite low. I enjoyed how easy it was to talk to you and thanks for making sure that everyone felt comfortable with the assignment in terms of workload / deadlines. All the best! ~ Shiv      </p>
