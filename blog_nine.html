                    <p> Learning about the history of JavaScript has made me think about how much JavaScript has developed over the past 20 years. Application Programming Interface (API) is an interface between two implementations. API’s provide a set of operations which is defined by inputs and outputs; and second, it allows reimplementation without compromising its users (Sandoval, 2018). API’s were invented by Maurice Wikes, David Wheeler, and Stanley Gill (Sandoval, 2018).<br> <br>
                        API’s are used in many types of websites such as commerce, social media, cloud computing, and mobile. Without API’s, websites such as Facebook wouldn’t allow users to access their friends, photos, events and profile information. Everything is become more mobile. Google maps was invented in 2006 in which the Google Maps API was made using reverse engineering and “hacking the JavaScript application”. <br> <br>
                        “Location became a major topic of the API conversation that we were about to have on every mobile device solid in the next couple of years” (Lane, 2019). JavaScript has developed over the past 20 years, and is still “only just beginning the journey”. Web APIS can be used to connect almost to the internet, and are “regularly being used to invent entirely new products and services, as well as constructing ecosystems” (Lane, 2019). <br> <br>
                    
                        Understanding how to adjust the position of elements on a page is useful as we can adjust how the position of images by attaching variables to tags such as li. I'm slowly starting to learn how every bit of HTML interacts with each other, which opens up a lot more potential for creating websites in the near future. These pre-recorded lectures have taught me how to interact with HTML and CSS using JavaScript in a logical manner which I will be using in the future. Thank you!</p>
