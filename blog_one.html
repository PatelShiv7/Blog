                        <p>Hello, my name is Shiv Patel and I am a third year studying interaction design and marketing. 
                            What interests me in web design is how everything that we learn is user focused which fascinates me.
                            I aspire to be a UI/UX designer with coding & marketing knowledge. This ensures that I can create designs 
                            that are possible to create in a real-life situation. I have always had an interest in coding since I 
                            was in college. Coding languages that I have learnt are: <br> <br>

                            <ul>
                                <li> HTML (8/10), CSS (7/10), Javascript (6/10), Scratch (9/10), Python (7/10), Java(4/10) <br> <br> </li>     
                            </ul>

                            <p>As a python tutor for work (teaching kids), I’ve been teaching how to format variables using .format() in a method. 
                            I was always curious on how you would implement this into javascript until last class where you could use 
                            ${variable_name} to insert a variable. For this example, I’ve defined a variable named ‘name1’ which will ask for 
                            the users’ name and store it in name1. If the response is == to ‘Shiv’, the program will send an alert saying, 
                            “Hi shiv, that’s a cool name”, else, alert saying the computer is not familiar with that name. This is useful for 
                            creating data-fields such as usernames, emails etc. <br> <br>I am hoping that from this class, I will be able to learn more 
                            about interactivity on a website as I lack website javascript knowledge compared to mathematical programming. 
                            Learning `${}` was very useful to me and I hope I can continue to learn more things. </p>
