                    <p> JavaScript is better know as <strong> The Modern Web</strong>. There are many other type of JavaScript frameworks such as Backbonejs, knockoutjs, angular, react, javascript, es6, typescript, and babel. This is just a list of a few and there are so many more languages that have been developed over the past 20 years. <br>
                        The modern web consists of 4 characteristics which are HTML / CSS / JS, Jquery, Frameworks and Tooling. HTML is the basic structure of a site which is enhanced by other technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. jQuery is designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML such as interactive slideshows.<br>
                        Javascript consists of many framework libaries that consist of pre-written JavaScript such as <br> <br>
                        Angular - Powerful, efficient, and open-source JavaScript framework which allows the coder to extend the HTML inside the application and "interprets the attrivutes to perform data binding" (Arora, 2021) <br> <br>
                        React - Used to develop and operate the dynamic user itnerface of the web page with high incoming traffic. Allows for a virtual DOM. Websites include code academy, facebook, instagram and yahoo mail. <br> <br>
                        JSX - allows the coder to write HTML in react - makes life easier. <br> <br>
                        This weeks JavaScript informed me on how important interactivity is on a website. Using conditional statements inside eventListeners has taught me ways on making sure that elements can be shown / hidden on the webpage. Timeouts in conjunction with functions are useful to give it a delay. This can be useful for window popup boxes upon entering a webpage which is what I'll be doing for the next assignment.</p>
