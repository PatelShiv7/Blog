                    <p> The bias blind spot is the tendency of people who see themselves as less susceptible to nonconscious predispositions and cognitive influences than others (Pronin, 2020). The Harvard test presented black faces, white faces, good words such as love, joy, peace, and bad words such as evil, hurt, failure. The challenge was to take this test at speed to see if users preferred white people over black. Psychologists have “critiqued the paradigm by saying it merely tests awareness of stereotypes, not endorsement of them, But the subconscious cannot distinguish between the two; it speaks only in the language of association” (Hutson, 2013). This test was interesting as it predicted the behaviour of users. Self-stereotyping was a key factor which played an important part as people didn’t “want to admit their biases to themselves (Hutson, 2013).
                    Biases are stuck in our brain. “Rooted in the human brain’s automatic processing systems, unconscious decision-making has played an important role in the survival and evolution of species” (AESC, 2021). Many processes that we encounter on a daily basis can reflect our biases towards different situations. For example, if us as young users continued to hang out with people who don’t like older people, our brain influences this bias towards older people which is stuck with us in our cognitive memory until we overcome this problem. </p> <br>
                    <p> Arrays are an efficient way on storing multiple values in a variable. Many types of methods can be used to access values inside these variables. The .join() method was very useful when displaying information inside of an array. This made it look good as you can customise how the information is displayed on the page. .includes() method is useful for checking if an item in an array exists. This is useful in-conjunction with an if else statement to do something is a condition is true. indexOf() is useful for getting the position of an element. This can be used when using other array techniques such as .push(), .pop(), .unshift(), .shift().
                    Objects are a collection of properties, which contains a key and a value. A properties value is stored under the key. Objects are predefined in the browser, which allows the user to define their own objects. Objects are useful when multiple types of information are stored. An example of this is a name (key) and Shiv (value). Object oriented programming has taught me how to be efficient when displaying multiple types of values inside of an array. 
                    Learning how to use DOM was something that I've been looking forward to ever since the first day. It's interesting how we can manipulate data using Javascript to give the website more interactivity between the user and the code. Using methods such as document.getElementByID/ClassName/TagName() & document.querySelector() make editing data so much easier for the coder. These methods have further enhanced how I'd use all Javascript methods that we've learnt in this class. </p>
