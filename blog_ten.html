                    <p> Reflective research is an important aspect of professional development as it allows us to see what went well, and what didn’t, which allows us to tweak our approach for the future. Reflexive research is done during the moment which allows us to understand much deeper. “Reflective thinkers will analyse what has happened, however a reflexive thinker will automatically self-assess and react to circumstances as they are happening” (Parenta, 2019). For users to be reflexive, we need to recognise our surroundings, and being to “critically take circumstances and relationships into consideration rather than merely reacting to them, which helps review and revise ethical ways or being and relating in our world” (LFS, 2021).<br> <br>
                        During the second assignment, I was more favoured towards reflective research as I needed to pay close attention to my psychological state when analysing my bias towards ageism. Sometimes when I noticed my bias occurring, I had to act and stop myself based on my intuition as I started to grasp that it’s wrong to differentiate behaviours due to ageism. I’ve noticed I’ve reflected my process towards self-direct ageism as I was able to describe my actions, learn from them, and will improve for the future. <br> <br>
                        The reason why we didn't follow this approach is because we thought it'd be easier to delegate all the tasks to meet the hand in date. 
                        My design reflection was based towards reflexive research as I related back to ethics and mentioned the methods that I had used. Noticing the different behaviour methods after the research showed me my biases towards ageism which I was not happy with. I was able to justify why things happened which were related back to theories learned in class. I believe it’s important to do both reflective and reflexive research because throughout the whole process, you should be thinking about what you’re doing, and how you can improve on it as you take the next step throughout the brief. </p>
