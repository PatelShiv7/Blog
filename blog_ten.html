                                                    <p> At the start of this project, I wanted to organise the team so that we could all be comfortable with our own roles. Originally,
                                                     the plan was to have Christian as the researcher as we felt like he was the most experienced with researching design elements 
                                                     and had the least experience with creating wireframes and coding. <br> <br>
                                                     Issy was going to be in charge of the digital marketing side where
                                                     she would implement ways on getting more conversions through call to actions, content etc. I was primarily going to focus on coding
                                                     as I had the most experience in the group. <br> <br>
                                                     The reason why we didn't follow this approach is because we thought it'd be easier to delegate all the tasks to meet the hand in date. 
                                                     If we had more time on the project, we would've followed the agile framework we originally planned from the start.
