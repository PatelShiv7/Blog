                    <p> From last lecture, it made me think about the process regarding user experience design
                        on a website. It is important that all websites follow a similar process which starts
                        with the user needs, content requirements, interaction design, interface design, then lastly
                        the visual design. In general, I was quite unfamilar with the strategy / scope of a design, so
                        I decided to analyse these aspects in my assignment. <br> <br> 

                        Last weeks lecture reminds me how everything that we do involves user experience. For the 
                        task where we did our own journey from start to finish, mine started with making weet-bix in
                        the morning but ran out of milk, not being able to see from inside the car, snapper card has 
                        no money in it, and a lecture getting cancelled All these factors could have been solved with 
                        better user experience. <br> <br>

                        For example, I did not have enough milk because the day before I spilt milk cause the bowl 
                        had an irregular shape. If the bowl had a shape that could stop milk from spilling, I would 
                        have had enough milk for today. Another example is that my lecture got cancelled as I was on 
                        the train. A simple push notification from Blackboard informing me that the lecture is
                        cancelled would have been very helpful. <br> <br>

                        Regarding Javascript conditional statements, it is important that coders use these as much
                        as possible to reduce the amount of code needed. Without if else statements, programmers
                        would be repeating excess code which is not efficient in a real-life situation. We as humans
                        don't notice it but everything that we use in the real world & online world uses conditional
                        statements. For example, if I had a file on my computer, if I wanted to save the file > (save)
                        else > (don't save) or if someone was offering coffee, if I want coffee > (say yes) else > (say no).
