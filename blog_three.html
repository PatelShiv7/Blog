                    <p> It's important that designers think about the psychological aspects in a website to focus on what users expect on one. I never
                        really thought about the psychology side that much until this lecture which was quite good. 
                        There are many techniques to apply psychology to websites such as the serial position effect which is 
                        subcategorised into the primary effect and the recency effect. <br> <br>

                        The primary effect states that users tend to recall first items with greater accuracy
                        due to the small amount of processing effort spent rehearsing them.

                        The serial position effect makes it so that you can control user behaviour by placing items
                        or information in a particular order. This idea is mostly used in e-commerce websites where
                        they list the expensive item first then the cheapier onces. This would encourage the user
                        to make the purchase on the expensive item. (Yelina, 2020) <br> <br>

                        I've noticed a trend that 7 years ago, designs followed a skeuomorphism theme with apps such
                        as instagram and youtube, but now they follow a flat design to maintain minimalism. 
                        I wasn't sure on what this was called at first, but it was really interesting idea to look at
                        for cognitive psychology. <br> <br>

                        Math objects are very useful as we can use this to randomly generate numbers. This can be used 
                        for randomizing what slideshow picture will appear on the screen. The screenshot shows a dice 
                        game which continues to play if the user types in yes. This uses a while loop in conjunction with 
                        an if else statement. These work well with each other as the program will only repeat if the if/else
                        statement is true / false.
