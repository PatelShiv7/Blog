                    <p> Design exploration is an important part in a design as it follows from the background research we did for part 1. Our methodology and discussion on garrett's ux elements help us to form what's needed for the user. 
                    When designing this website, I made sure to follow all the user needs that I mentioned for the strategy because without this, the user wouldn't get anything from the website which defeats the purpose of the whole website. <br> <br>
                    I transformed these needs into basic requirements that the site will need such as onboarding messages that support the user with navigation. This was crucial as one of my needs for the users were to not be lost throughout the process. 
                    For the structure, the user would click on a box that would open up an affordance that shows the user how to use a page. Without the scope, this interaction wouldn't be a thing, which would negatively affect my user needs and the product objectives. 
                    For the skeleton, I used a button which is shown on all pages to give the user tips on the page. Without the decision on where the button is located, the user could be confused on where to find help, which will make the user confused, which then defeats one of the user needs. 
                    Finally for the surface, I used a question mark as older users are familar with question marks being symbolised for confusion or help as this is one of the few mental models that a older user has. If I decided to use a different icon, the user wouldn't know what the button is, which ultimately affects the user needs once again. 
                    <strong> Garrett's UX elements all link up with each other in some way - Onboarding / affordances were one of many ideas discussed in my assignment.</strong>  <br> <br>
                    For Javascript, it was interesting how we're starting to interact with adding and removing elements. As mentioned on the last blog, this was something that I was looking forward to and am happy to be doing now.
                    I've been having a deeper look into sign up forms from other websites and thinking about how they incoporate Javascript to their code. For example for Gmail, if the field was bank, they would create new text using document.getElementsByTagName then append text saying that you must enter a field.
                    This would be useful when creating an email system with a login system (if my website got chosen for A3). </p>
